The wind is telling stories about us
Writing words with sand and powder dust
Deserted squares and lonesome trees
The wind revealing stories about us

Fall is telling stories about us
Writing words with leaves and powder dust
Multi colored lanes of trees
Mesmerizing stories about us

We all float
On clouds of gold
The mountains make the sun rise
Your rainbow colored eyes can change the tide

The river telling stories about us
Writing words with water full of lust
Yellow purple green or blue
Drip by drip revealing things on you
