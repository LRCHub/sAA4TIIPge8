The wind is telling stories about us
Writing words in sand and powdered dust
Deserted squares and lonesome trees
The wind revealing stories about us

Fall is telling stories about us
Writing words with leaves and powdered dust
Multicoloured lanes of trees
Mesmerising stories about us

We all float
Clouds of gold
Mountains make the sun arise
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide

We all float
Clouds of gold
Mountains make the sun arise
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide

The river telling stories about us
Writing words in water full of lust
Yellow purple green or blue
Drip by drip revealing things on you

We all float
Clouds of gold
Mountains make the sun arise
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide

We all float
Clouds of gold
Mountains make the sun arise
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide

Mountains make the sun arise
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide
