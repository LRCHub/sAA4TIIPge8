I saw you in the carpet shades
Then I felt you like a baby's face
Just float along and fill your lungs
Flot along and breathe a deep breath

I saw you in the paper folds
And I saw you in my coffee mug
Just float along and fill your lungs
Float along and breathe a deep breath

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath
Just float along and fill your lungs
