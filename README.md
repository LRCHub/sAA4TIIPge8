# Samm Henshaw – Float

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Here we go again
Search for love in the
wrong places
How can I be surprised
I had you at your best
Like the beauty of a sunset
Never know when it's 'bout end
Can we turn back the time
Could you read back the lines
When you said that you loved me
Babe did you mean that always
Can we turn back the time
Could you read back the lines
Don't let me float darling
The world looks so much
better with you
Don't let me go darling
There's so much more that
we said we'd do
Don't let me float
Don't let me float
Float without you you you you
Don't you ever tell me
this ain't love
I'd still be there on your
worst nights
Praying the wind blows me
by your side
By your side
Do you ever think we didn't
try enough
Words that I don't want to
live by
I'd like to think we got
endless skies tell me why
Can we turn back the time
Could you read back the lines
When you said that you loved me
Babe did you mean that always
Always always always
Don't let me float darling
The world looks so much
better with you
Don't let me go darling
There's so much more that
we said we'd do
Don't let me float
Don't let me float
Float without you you you you
